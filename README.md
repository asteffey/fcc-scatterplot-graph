## Data Visualization Projects - Visualize Data with a Scatterplot Graph

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/asteffey/fcc-scatterplot-graph.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/asteffey/fcc-scatterplot-graph)

The site is hosted at https://asteffey.github.io/fcc-scatterplot-graph/.  
Alternatively, it can be viewed with the [freeCodeCamp test suite](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js) 
by appending [`?fcc-test`](https://asteffey.github.io/fcc-scatterplot-graph/?fcc-test) to the URL.

This is a [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) project which uses D3 to create scatterplot chart of doping information in professional bicycle racing.y
Additionally, this project also demonstrates the use of React, ESLint, and a basic CI/CD pipeline using Travis with deployment to GitHub pages.

The project requirements can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/data-visualization-projects/visualize-data-with-a-scatterplot-graph.
